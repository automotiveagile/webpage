# Automotive Agile

## Why? Reasons for Automotive Agile

In the last couple of years, the Manifesto for Agile Software Development became the guideline for almost all software development projects. Looking towards development for Web or mobile Applications, Backend Services (Clouds), you'll probably find no classic project management anymore. Upfront project planning simply doesn't work for software development and was abandoned for the sake of incremental-iterative work models (we simply call them today "agile").

But not in Automotive. Automotive (embedded) software development still clamps to the waterfall project management. The main reason to stick with waterfall processes is the believe that the software is "finished" at some point of time: Start of production (SOP). If you have some sort of car control unit, it is developed, built and delivered before the car hits production. Continous updates and bug fixes are not possible or very expensive. You have no "DevOps" or even "Ops", the software is in field and cann't be patched or fixed anymore (or only by workshop updates and car recalls).
